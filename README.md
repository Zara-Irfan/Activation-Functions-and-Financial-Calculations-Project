# README: Activation Functions and Financial Calculations Project

## Overview

This repository demonstrates Python programming for:

1. **Deep Learning Activation Functions**: sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU.
2. **Financial Calculations using NumPy**: revenue, expenses, profit, and total sales calculations.

The project combines mathematical concepts and coding practices, showcasing professional skills suitable for a portfolio.

## Activation Functions

* **Sigmoid**: Converts any number into a value between 0 and 1.
* **Tanh**: Converts numbers into a value between -1 and 1.
* **ReLU**: Returns 0 for negative numbers, and the number itself if positive.
* **Leaky ReLU**: Similar to ReLU but allows a small value for negatives.

## Financial Calculations

* Calculate **profit** by subtracting expenses from revenue.
* Calculate **total sales per product** and **total revenue per row** using NumPy dot product.
